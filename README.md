# ABOUT
This will be a documentation of my attempts at recreating a classic 2-D platformer game following instructions from a tutorial book, Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.

This game will be using the Pygame library and is intended for me to learn to intricacies of Pygame as well as improve on my Python knowledge.
